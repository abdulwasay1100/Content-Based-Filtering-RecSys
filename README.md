# Content-Based-Filtering-RecSys

In the collaborative filtering, we generated two vectors, a user vector and an item/movie vector whose dot product would predict a rating. The vectors were derived solely from the ratings.   

Content-based filtering also generates a user and movie feature vector but recognizes there may be other information available about the user and/or movie that may improve the prediction.
The additional information is provided to a neural network which then generates the user and movie vector as shown below.
